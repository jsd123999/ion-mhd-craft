The Butterfly-to-Orbit Profile:
	1.	You lift off in silence.
A soft surge. The capacitors discharge. The ion field hums.
No roar, no flames—just rising.
	2.	You climb to the stratosphere.
The Earth curves below. Air thins.
The heat on the hull begins to flow inward. Energy is stored.
You glide.
	3.	You pulse forward again.
Another gentle burst. The sky darkens.
There’s no rush. You ride momentum and atmospheric friction like an albatross on thermal winds.
	4.	Each boost lifts you higher.
You see stars before leaving Earth.
There’s still enough air to heat the hull and power the loop.
	5.	Eventually, you’re above 100 km.
You coast now. You’re in orbit.
And not a single drop of fuel was burned.
You drift on quiet power—charged by heat, shaped by magnetism, lifted by physics alone.
